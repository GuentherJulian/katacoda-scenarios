    -Includes a link to add the manifest.json file.

    -Adds meta tags for theme-color.

    -Installs icon files to support the installed Progressive Web App (PWA).

    -Creates the service worker configuration file called ngsw-config.json, which specifies the caching behaviors and other settings.
