## Setting up your java project

Navigate to the 'workspaces/main/' folder in your devonfw installation directory.
`cd workspaces/main/`{{execute}}

Now you can use devon to setup a java project for you.
`devon java create com.example.application.cobigenexample`{{execute}}

This will create a new devon4j application. You can find more information about devon4j on https://devonfw.com/website/pages/docs/devon4j.asciidoc.html.

Switch into the newly create project directory.
`cd cobigenexample/`{{execute}}
