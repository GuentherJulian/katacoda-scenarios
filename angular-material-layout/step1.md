# Letâ€™s begin

Install angular CLI executing `npm install @angular/cli -g`{{ execute }}.

Run the following command to start a project named devon4ng-mat-layout

- `ng new devon4ng-mat-layout`{{ execute }}

Select `y` when it asks whether it would like to add Angular routing and select `SCSS` when it asks for the stylesheet format.

Once the creation process is complete, open your newly created application in Visual Studio Code. Try running the empty application by running the following command:

- `ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check`{{execute}}

Angular will spin up a server and you can check your application by visiting https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-4200-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/ in your browser.
